💻 Project: Countdown & Quotes Application
 📝 Project Definition
📌 Title: Countdown & Quotes Application
💡 Objective:
 To create a JavaScript-based interactive application that shows a real-time countdown timer to a specific event, an automatic quotes slider, and a modal popup that appears after a delay. The app will use arrays, loops, functions, ES6 features, DOM manipulation, setTimeout, setInterval, and clearInterval to provide a dynamic user experience.

🧩 Project Flow
⏳ Countdown Timer
Start a countdown timer to a future event (e.g., New Year, Exam Date).
Use setInterval() to update the timer every second.
When the timer reaches zero, stop using clearInterval() and display: “Time’s up! The event has started 🎉”.
💬 Quotes Slider
Store 5–6 motivational quotes in an array.
Use a loop to switch between quotes automatically every 3–5 seconds using setInterval().
Quotes are displayed dynamically on the webpage.
🖼️ Modal Popup
After 5 seconds of page load, show a modal window using setTimeout().
The modal contains a welcome message or event information.
Users can close the modal using a close button.
🎯 User Interactions
Buttons for Start/Pause Countdown (toggle between setInterval() and clearInterval()).
Manual Next/Previous buttons for quotes in addition to automatic sliding.
✅ Final Output
Countdown Timer displayed on the webpage.
Motivational quotes changing automatically.
Modal popup with event/welcome message.

💡 Example Output:
Countdown to New Year 🎉:
 10 Days 05 Hours 20 Minutes 45 Seconds
Quote Slider:
 "Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts."
Modal (after 5 seconds):
 "Welcome to Countdown & Quotes App 🚀 — Stay motivated!"

⏳ Duration: 1.5 Hours
